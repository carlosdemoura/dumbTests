The goal of this is to test.

The goal of `meteobr` is to provide an easy way to get data from the automated meteorological stations of Brazil's [National Institute of Meteorology](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Nacional_de_Meteorologia). These stations provide, at each hour of every day between 2000-2024, a plethora of useful data (see below).


## Installation

You can install the development version of meteobr from [GitHub](https://github.com/carlosdemoura/meteobr/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("carlosdemoura/meteobr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(meteobr)



```
